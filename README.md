<b><li>Additional Info</li></b>

CJ will help me see what else to add to the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Thegladster/chess-bot-v3/blob/master/requirements.txt) file because I don't really know.

After installing requirements and cloning the repository, if command prompt is reopened

<b><li>Troubleshooting</li></b>

If after cloning repository, command prompt outputs this fatal error:

```bash
fatal: destination path 'chess-bot-v3' already exists and is not an empty directory.
```

Pull the repository instead of cloning it. The resulting code will look like

```bash
git pull https://github.com/Thegladster/chess-bot-v3
```
